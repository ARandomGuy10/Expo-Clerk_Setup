   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Project Structure

```
app/
  (auth)/           # Authentication screens
  (tabs)/           # Main app tabs (protected routes)
  _layout.js        # Root layout with Clerk provider
  index.js          # Entry point (redirects to auth or home)
```

## Authentication

This starter includes the following authentication screens:

- Sign In (email/password, Google, Apple)
- Sign Up (email/password, Google, Apple)
- Forgot Password
- Reset Password
- Email Verification

## Customization

### Adding a new screen
1. Create a new file in the appropriate directory (e.g., `app/new-screen.js`)
2. Export a React component as the default export
3. Use the `useRouter` hook from `expo-router` for navigation

### Styling
This project uses React Native's StyleSheet for styling. For a more scalable approach, consider using a styling solution like:
- `styled-components`
- `nativewind`
- `tamagui`

## Deployment

### Web
```bash
npx expo export:web
```

### iOS/Android
Follow the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/) for building and publishing your app.
